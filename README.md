# Parcel benchmark action

This is an experimental GitHub Action for testing Parcel's performance and bundle size on a couple demo applications to automatically measure and report performance impact of PRs on these examples.

This can also be extended in the future to automatically report performance comparison with other bundling tools for each release.
