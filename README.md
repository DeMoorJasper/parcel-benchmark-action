# Parcel benchmark action

This is an experimental GitHub Action for testing Parcel's performance and bundle size on a couple demo applications.

## Features

These are just a couple features I'm thinking of writing before I'd consider this project complete

- Create a set of projects to bundle (small, large, modern JS, older JS, non-JS, ...)
- Add comparison with v2 branch
- Add comparison with other Bundling Tools
- Benchmark speed on both dev and production
- Benchmark bundle size only on production

This featureset is far from complete and just a guideline for myself while developing the first version.

Feel free to open up issues with new features you'd like.
